This is multi-threaded app for naive checking if number is prime.

Just type the positive number in the console. 
It works with delay so it works like:
```
(input)
    125
    784
    ...
    ...
    {5 SEC DELAY}
    ...
(output)
    number 125	prime ?	false
    number 784	prime ?	false
```

If you want to exit type negative number.
